## Game rules

These are taken from the [Commodore 16 Showcase booklet](http://plus4world.powweb.com/publications/The_Commodore_16_Showcase_Booklet) . They will be added to as game functionality becomes available.

### Objective

You are a lone XZAPPER, last survivor of an advanced civilisation. Many centuries ago, your planet was besieged by alien hordes. Now only you remain. The aliens have the advantage of numbers, but you are on home territory.

Your objective is to destroy the aliens on each level, and so progress through 140 different levels.
